Yes, it's me, Matthias. I am working as a SW Architect at BMW in Munich.

Starting very early I was into tech. Disassembling stuff and reassembling it optimized (always some spare parts left) I got into computers pretty early. Don't judge me by my first programming language, which was PHP. It was in a time where you usually name your files `.php3`. I went to a lot of web developing during my teenage years. Then going embedded mostly during doing my computer science degree got me.

I experienced large companies, as freelancer, mid sized companies and contractors. I did full stack not only in web, but in complete systems, from backend, infrastructure to UI. 
I am curious about a lot of things: C++, Python, CI, testing, vim, tmux, automation to name just a few.
I do not like to do repeated tasks by hand, I am awfully lazy and I like playing around with bleeding edge tech stuff.

I like to make things better than today. This starts with software and tests, but does not end there. Better processes, better experience, more trust in each other. I appreciate teamwork not competition.
I hope to be able to inspire people and help them to get better whatever they want to do. And so do I, looking for new fields to explore, olds to get better. 

Besides that I am into Dungeons & Dragons, I like cooking (maybe because it basically is executing algorithms) and doing experiments with my daughter.
