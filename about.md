# m42e - about me

Yes, it's me, Matthias. I am working as a SW Architect at BMW in Munich. And as a good software architect I am also a developer.
I am curious about a lot of things: C++, Python, CI, Testing, vim, tmux, automation to just name a few.
I do not like to do repeated tasks by hand, I am awfully lazy and I like playing around with tech stuff.
I also like being inspired, this is why I have starred a whole lot of repositories, as they might be interesting at some future point of time.

Besides that I am into Dungeons and Dragons and I like cooking (maybe because it basically is executing algorithms).
