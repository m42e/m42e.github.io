Yes, it's me, Matthias. I am working as a SW Architect at BMW in Munich.

Starting very early I was into tech. Disassembling stuff and reassembling it optimized (always some spare parts left) I got into computers pretty early. Don't judge me by my first programming language, which was PHP. It was in a time where you usually name your files `.php3`. I went to a lot of web developing during my teenage years. Then going embedded mostly during doing my computer science degree got me.

I experienced large companies, as freelancer, mid sized companies and contractors. I did full stack not only in web, but in complete systems, from backend, infrastructure to UI. 
I am curious about a lot of things: C++, Python, CI, testing, vim, tmux, automation to name just a few.
I do not like to do repeated tasks by hand, I am awfully lazy and I like playing around with bleeding edge tech stuff.

Besides tech I hope to be able to inspire people and help them to get better whatever they want to do. 

Besides that I am into Dungeons and Dragons and I like cooking (maybe because it basically is executing algorithms).
