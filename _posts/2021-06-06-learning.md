title: That did not start well. Missed already some weeks...

Ok, here we are. I already missed some weeks, but hey, don't mind. I wanted to challenge myself into writing and now I have to possibilities:

- Ignore the fact, that I missed already some weeks posts, or
- cancel the project completely because I missed my own expectations. 

And I have chosen the first one.

## I would have done this different in the past.

Maybe I am not the only one, but for sure I would have acted different in the past. My favourite choice and of course the one that is a lot easier is the second one. But I do not want to cancel this. It is a good practice for me to write about things. 

I usually assume that everyone knows a lot more than I do, aka. imposter syndrome. I mean I think of myself that I know pretty much, and from pretty broad topics, too. But still I am not confident, in a lot of areas. This is one thing that is hindering me from telling other people about what I am doing and how. I expect to bore them because for sure they already know it anyway.

The decision to continue is a decision I am doing for myself. I do not expect anybody to read this here at all :)

So enough insights, let us see what we have here this week.
