## This is my new challenge

I try to write a blog post, once a week, with at least one C++ feature I either like or have learned about recently.
I take bets on how long I continue this.

I know a lot of others are doing this and you all might be bored about just another blog like this. But if there is someone out there, who is interested do not hesitate to reach out and let me know about it. 

You can reach my using mail, [twitter](https://twitter.com/m42e_de) or [Threema](https://threema.id/SJPYUFBN).
